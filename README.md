Ex3eTracker
===========

A web-based tool to simplify combat math in [Exalted 3E](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/200664283/deluxe-exalted-3rd-edition). Try it at http://bartkusa.com/ex/.

Current major features:

* Outside of combat
	* Create a list of "persistent characters," both PCs and NPCs, and write down notes about their combat stats.
	* Save/load those characters from your browser's local storage.
* In combat
	* Track which of those characters have (or haven't) gone.
	* Track each character's initiative in combat.
